Why are visual novels suddenly so popular?,https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-visual-novels-suddenly-so-popular," 
If you've visited Steam in the last decade, you're likely already acquainted with visual novels. Though games like Famicom Detective's Club saw the inception of the visual novel in the 1980s, they've reached a particular zenith on Steam, thanks mostly to a plethora of very horny games.

But hidden among the shovelware is a wealth of original and interesting pie..."
Dear Square Enix: please bring back Final Fantasy's mini-games,https://www.eurogamer.net/dear-square-enix-please-bring-back-final-fantasys-minigames," 
Ask me to pick two moments that sum up Final Fantasy X and I'd probably roll with 1) Yuna dancing on the ocean at Kilika to send the souls of the dead to the Farplane, and 2) Tidus performing a Sphere Shot in Blitzball. The first because it's a mesmerising performance of grief and transcendence, the second because it's patently daft in the best of ways. Blitzba..."
The very strange yet promising yet too-weird world of Eternal Champions,https://www.eurogamer.net/the-very-strange-yet-promising-yet-too-weird-world-of-eternal-champions," 
I can't remember when I bought Eternal Champions, which is annoying because I always remember obscure purchases to the detriment of remembering genuinely useful things. Besides the fact it would have been a Mega Drive game I hadn't seen before, I can be fairly confident that the game cover sold it to me. I would have been about 10 at the time and my sole refere..."
Baldur's Gate 3 PC tech review: polish that puts other AAA games to shame,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-pc-tech-review-polish-that-puts-other-aaa-games-to-shame," Baldur's Gate 3 has left a long early access period to critical acclaim and massive success - and after playing it I can understand why. Baldur's Gate 3 digitises the free-form gameplay of D&D in a way that keeps the spirit of the tabletop role-playing game intact, resulting in some of the most interactive and reactive narrative and gameplay that the medium has ..."
How En Garde!'s fencing earned its cinematic flourishes,https://www.eurogamer.net/how-en-gardes-fencing-earned-its-cinematic-flourishes," 
During my twenties, I decided that I would start fencing.

I wasn't very strong, but I did have some quickness and agility, and I liked how fencers seemed to epitomise those last two qualities. I wasn't very good at the sport, ultimately, because fencing doesn't just require speed and agility, but also timing, distance measurement, and skill. (I also foolishly ..."
Game of the Week: Turbo Overkill and the joys of video game excess,https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-the-week-turbo-overkill-and-the-joys-of-video-game-excess," 
One thing I remember about lockdown is this weird thing that happened when lockdown ended. After days and weeks and months of being indoors - home schooling, masked chats to the Tesco delivery people and endless Netflix binges of Below Deck - just stepping outside was this wild kind of sensory overload.

And I mean any kind of stepping outside. Taking the bins ..."

The Order: 1886 pushed visuals hard in 2015 - and still looks stunning today,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-order-1886-pioneered-modern-rendering-techniques-in-2015-and-remains-a-stunning-title-in-2023," In February 2015, The Order: 1886 came and went. This third-person narrative-driven action game arrived on PS4 with plenty of hype, but it delivered what felt like a prologue for a larger concept and achieved a lowly Metacritic score of just 63. Some loved it of course, but the game never received a sequel or even a PS4 Pro upgrade. It's a game with limitations,..."

DirectX 11 vs Vulkan: which is best for Baldur's Gate 3?,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-directx-11-vs-vulkan-which-is-best," The Baldur's Gate 3 launcher offers a choice between DirectX 11 and Vulkan - so which is the best in terms of performance and stability? The launcher defaults to DX11, while Larian support documents suggest Vulkan, so in the face of this conflicting advice there's only one thing to do: get testing. We trialled both options on a range of systems with Nvidia, Inte..."
"Thronefall: kingdom building, hack-and-slash, and the spirit of Lumines?!",https://www.eurogamer.net/thronefall-kingdom-building-hack-and-slash-and-the-spirit-of-lumines," 
For the last few days I've been trying to understand what it is exactly that Thronefall reminds me of. This is the follow-up game from the small team that made Islanders, a brilliant minimalist city builder that I properly love. Although Thronefall has its own city building elements and a breezy deftness when it comes to conjuring a sense of nature, it's not Is..."
The joys of Pokémon Go Fest London,https://www.eurogamer.net/the-joys-of-pokemon-go-fest-london," 
Pokémon Go's newly-introduced Showcases are one of my favourite additions to the game in years. They're local leaderboards, in a nutshell - a feature which first debuted in developer Niantic's now-canned NBA All-Stars - that let you show off specific Pokémon and win in-game rewards. What's really great about Showcases, though, is their smart design with a very ..."
A weekend with Clash Mini,https://www.eurogamer.net/a-weekend-with-clash-mini," 
I've been excited about Clash Mini since it was announced. The idea's simple: the Clash universe, with all the units and concepts I already understand, but this time instead of the streamlined tower-defence battles of Clash Royale, it's something closer to a brisk spin on the auto battler genre. This is a sort of game I'd always wanted to get into but struggled..."
Pikmin 4 delivers an Unreal improvement over its predecessors,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-pikmin-4-tested-on-switch-nintendos-series-moves-to-unreal-engine," Hot off the heels of the Pikmin 1 and 2 HD remasters on  Switch, we have a completely new series entry in Pikmin 4. It's been a decade-long wait, but in that time Nintendo has jettisoned its in-house engine in favour of Unreal Engine 4, which provides some of the most striking visuals seen on Switch to date. But how much of a graphical leap is it over the Wii U ..."
"After 23 years, Starfield's ancestor Noctis is still a vision of the future",https://www.eurogamer.net/after-23-years-starfields-ancestor-noctis-is-still-a-vision-of-the-future," 
Over the decades I've been playing video games, I've flown spaceships made of futuristic alloys and bubbles of energy, and I've flown spaceships hammered together from wooden planks, chunky metal bolts and flapping sailcloth. I've flown ships that extrapolate believably from the design of the International Space Station, and I've flown ships that are basically ..."
Are you still playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom?,https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-still-playing-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom," 
I love Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's new Hyrule Field theme, with the warmth of its full chords and then that gorgeous single synth note that always feels like it's just emerging, like the first rays of morning but sustained. It's not exactly a melody, but a held note that colours your gameplay with something lovely and almost lyrical, without leaving you stran..."

Game of the Week: The blossoming fruits of a crowdfunding revolution,https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-the-week-the-blossoming-fruits-of-a-crowdfunding-revolution," It's hard to ignore this week's big release because everyone's talking about it. And before I talk about it, I want to quickly flag up the wonderful Venba, a game that tells a story through cooking, and makes me very hungry just reading about it. Emad was really taken with it in his Venba review. But back to the big game, the whopper which, if you're me, you've ..."

Why Baldur's Gate 3's faithful recreation of Dungeons & Dragons is so exciting,https://www.eurogamer.net/why-baldurs-gate-3s-faithful-recreation-of-dungeons-dragons-is-so-exciting," Baldur's Gate 3 comes out on PC today and people seem to be talking about it everywhere.

What does surprise me is where the other surge of excitement is coming from, because it's something I haven't seen before. It'..."
Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest is a theme park for its passionate community,https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community," 
Naoki Yoshida, Final Fantasy 14's producer and director, has repeatedly described the MMORPG as a theme park for the series, with its wealth of distractions and references to multiple games.

If that's the case, then the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest event is the real-life theme park: full of activities, but plagued by queue times.

Too big for Steam Deck? Remnant 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart tested,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-too-big-for-steam-deck-remnant-2-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart," Two of the most technically advanced current-gen titles have just launched on PC - Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Remnant 2. These games push features like ray tracing, advanced upsampling, virtualised geometry and GPU-driven decompression, taxing even high-end PCs - and yet, both games also received Valve's Steam Deck Verified seal of approval. Can the modes..."
Diablo 4's Season of the Malignant is a hell of my own making,https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-season-1-is-a-hell-of-my-own-making," 
As an avid enthusiast of artful, purposeful suffering in games, returning to Diablo 4 for its first season seems, on the surface, like a joyful midnight binge at McDonalds: a hollow but familiar, mostly satisfying romp through your menu favourites, with useless tchotchkes that come with your meal, whether you want them or not. But once you hit endgame - I maxed..."

Knight Crawlers is a clever action-RPG with endearingly goofy baddies,https://www.eurogamer.net/knight-crawlers-is-a-clever-action-rpg-with-endearingly-goofy-baddies," 
Knight Crawlers is an action-RPG kind of thing that came out earlier this year. Having bounced off Diablo 4 a bit, I've still had an itch to disappear into the depths and smack skeletons around. Knight Crawlers has done me proud so far. I'm not too far in, but I'm having a great time.

It's a roguelite at heart. Each journey into the procedural depths sees you ..."
Skyrim modded with path-traced lighting - and all DX9+ games could follow,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-reshade-rtx-remix-path-tracing-add-on-ptgi," Enterprising developer Pascal Gilcher, best known for creating a ReShade add-on for ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), has unveiled his work on a path-traced version of Skyrim Special Edition.

Make Way reminds me of the time a friend fell down a flight of stairs while trying to show me a card trick. He was fine, I should say: fine at the start of it and mostly fine at the end of it. Merely flustered, mildly askew, as if he had encountered a bug he could not replicate.

The story of SWIV,https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-swiv," 
One of the more curious licensing phenomenons of the 80s was the home-exclusive sequel to an arcade game. Manchester's Ocean Software specialised in the trick, creating follow-ups such as Target: Renegade and Yie-Ar Kung Fu 2. However, as the 90s dawned, a general tightening of licensing laws meant fewer home-exclusive sequels appeared. Instead, inspired by an ..."
Can you make an anti-imperial empire game?,https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game," 
4X games may sound incredibly reductive on the surface. After all, this is the only genre of game whose name is also a decree about how you should play - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate. But as any fan will tell you, 4X games are actually bustling sandboxes that can be tackled in all kinds of ways. For some players, that could mean eschewing military acti..."
Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart PC tech analysis - this port needed more time,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-pc-tech-analysis," Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is out now on PC, two years after it launched as a PS5 exclusive.

There's a lot of parenting in Tren. This is surprising in some ways, because Tren is ostensibly a virtual train set that comes with a suite of ingenious puzzles and race challenges attached to it. But pull back a little and it starts to make more sense. With Tren, John Beech, the game's design lead, and Media Molecule's newly minted creative director, asked him..."

If you're anything like me, the idea of going back to school fills you with dread. I still have nightmares about exams for which I'm unprepared and I still lay awake at night remembering embarrassing things I did when I was fifteen.

Dragon's Dogma wants to surprise you - even if that means winding you up first,https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-wants-to-surprise-you-even-if-that-means-winding-you-up-first," 
When taken at face value, the review scores and Metacritic reception for Dragon's Dogma look extremely positive. Considering the never-ending discourse surrounding reviewer vs player scores, Dragon's Dogma seems like a strange anomaly. It's a game that everyone agrees is a solid 8 out of 10.

Gunbrella is one of those action games enlivened by a little bit of recurrent magic that never really fades. The magic lies with the Gunbrella itself. This is a 2D platformer and blaster, with a focus on exploration and a bit of light RPG stuff in the quests. But at the heart of it all is the Gunbrella your character wields, both gun and - yes - umbrella, and a..."
Portal: Prelude RTX brings a classic Source mod to the forefront of graphics technology,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-portal-prelude-rtx-brings-a-classic-source-mod-to-the-forefront-of-graphics-technology," Portal: Prelude RTX is an impressive showcase of Nvidia's RTX Remix technology, which takes what was once a Source mod for Portal and gives it visual features and technology that rival and even surpass high-end triple AAA releases. It is truly spectacular - and hopefully one of many path-traced remasters to come in the future as the RTX Remix modding tools appro..."

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an evolution. From the world of 2017's Breath of the Wild, Nintendo has created something richer and more malleable through a grander story, an expanded map, and the ability to build countless contraptions to torture innocent Koroks.

The Tomb Raider 2013 reboot trilogy by Crystal Dynamics was a statement of intent - a shot aimed directly at Nathan Drake and the Uncharted series.

At launch, the game was far less impressive though - a repetitive, empty game with surprisingly dated graphics despite its high budget. A dedicated patching campaign seems to have improved the title's plight, wit..."

Three weeks ago I told myself I wasn't going to play Dota 2 again until a new patch comes out. After the exciting launch of what might be the biggest patch of all time, games had started to become stale. At the admittedly average level I play at, a lot of games are all but over by the 20-minute mark, if you lose the lanes, it's incredibly hard to win. This mean..."

Hello everybody! Christian Donlan is away for this week's Game of the Week, so I'm afraid you all get a sorry consolation prize in the shape of me waffling about poltergeists. Why poltergeists? Because of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, of course. The current gen remaster has just launched and our Henry Stockdale was tickled pink, hailing it as a ""brilliant mys..."

Can Final Fantasy 16's real-time graphics compare to FF13's CGI cinematics?,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-can-final-fantasy-16s-real-time-graphics-compare-to-ff13s-cgi-cinematics," Final Fantasy games are well-known for their elaborate CGI movies - pre-rendered sequences which have traditionally highlighted key in-game moments where real-time rendering might prove insufficient. Final Fantasy 16 uses the technique rarely though, with a mix of real-time and pre-rendered in-engine footage largely used instead. With that in mind, I thought it ..."

Every year a few high-profile games are trickled out, while most other titles skip macOS entirely - but that might b..."

Final Fantasy is one of the most famous video game franchises in history.

A fresh first-party Nintendo Switch exclusive arrives in just a couple of days, though you'd be forgiven for being unaware.

One of my favourite paintings is Cucumber House, a watercolour - I think - by Eric Ravilious. It's an airy study in quiet. To me, it always feels like a day off school.

Foamstars is to Splatoon what Fortnite was to Playerunknown's Battlegrounds - a rip-off, yes, but also an admirably brazen one. And one that might actually take a single game and turn it into a whole genre. If it's very lucky - and also very good.
